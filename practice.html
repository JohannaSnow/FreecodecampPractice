<h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<!-- The style that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the "color" style.  -->

<!-- When you entered <h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>, you were giving that individual h2 element an inline style. -->

<!-- Inside that style element, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, your style element would look like this: -->
<style>
  h2{color: blue;}
</style>

<!-- You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.

You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:

<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period. -->


 <style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

/*
  All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.
Note that in most cases, img elements are self-closing.

<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="Kitty relaxing upside down ">

CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.
<style>
.larger-image {
   width: 100px;
 }
< /style>


/*changing size of image*/
<style>
.smaller-image {
  width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<img class="smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. " >


<!-- Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element by separating each class with a space within its class attribute. For example: -->

<img class="class1 class2">

<style>

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<img class="smaller-image thick-green-border"  src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. ">

 We can round out those corners with a CSS property called border-radius.

<style><
 .thick-green-border {
   border-color: green;
   border-width: 10px;
   border-style: solid;
   border-radius: 10px;
 }
 </style>

 In addition to pixels, you can also specify a border-radius using a percentage.


 <style><
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  </style>

  a elements, also known as anchor elements, are used to link to content outside of the current page.

<p> <a href='http://freecatphotoapp.com'>  Cat Photos </a> </p>

Nesting just means putting one element inside of another element.

Dead Links:

Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.

This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using jQuery, which we'll learn about later.

Replace the value of your a element's href attribute with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to turn it into a dead link.

<p>Click here for <a href="#">cat photos</a>.</p>



You can make elements into links by nesting them within an a element.

Nest your image within an a element. Here's an example:

<a href="#"><img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-running-cats" alt="Three kittens running towards the camera. "></a>

Remember to use # as your a element's href property in order to turn it into a dead link.

Place the existing image element within an anchor element.

Once you've done this, hover over your image with your cursor. Your cursor's normal pointer should become the link clicking pointer. The photo is now a link.

<a href="#"><img class="smaller-image thick-green-border" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. "></a>


HTML has a special element for creating unordered lists, or bullet point-style lists.

Unordered lists start with a <ul> element. Then they contain some number of <li> elements.

For example:

<ul>
  <li>milk</li>
  <li>cheese</li>
</ul>
would create a bullet point-style list of "milk" and "cheese".

<ul>
  <li>catnip</li>
  <li>grass</li>
  <li>kitty toys </li>
</ul>

HTML has a special element for creating ordered lists, or numbered-style lists.

Ordered lists start with a <ol> element. Then they contain some number of <li> elements.
  <ol>
    <li>water</li>
    <li>kisses</li>
    <li>dogs</li>
  </ol>

  Now let's create a web form.

Text inputs are a convenient way to get input from your user.

You can create one like this:

<input type="text">

Note that input elements are self-closing.


<!-- <input type="text"> <-----------======= creates a web form on DOM -->


Your placeholder text is what appears in your text input before your user has input anything.
<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">


 You can build web forms that actually submit data to a server using nothing more than pure HTML. You can do this by specifying an action on your form element.

 <form action="/submit-cat-photo">
<input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">
</form>


Let's add a submit button to your form. Clicking this button will send the data from your form to the URL you specified with your form's action attribute.

Here's an example submit button:

<button type="submit">this button submits the form</button>

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL">'
  <button type ="submit"> Submit </button>
</form>

You can require specific form fields so that your user will not be able to submit your form until he or she has filled them out.

For example, if you wanted to make a text input field required, you can just add the word required within your input element, you would use: <input type="text" required>

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

You can use radio buttons for questions where you want the user to only give you one answer.

Radio buttons are a type of input

Each of your radio buttons should be nested within its own label element.

All related radio buttons should have the same name attribute.

<label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
<label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>

Forms commonly use checkboxes for questions that may have more than one answer.

Checkboxes are a type of input

Each of your checkboxes should be nested within its own label element.

All related checkbox inputs should have the same name attribute.

Here's an example of a checkbox:

<label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Indoor</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Loving</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Feisty</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Cuddly</label>
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>


You can set a checkbox or radio button to be checked by default using the checked attribute.

To do this, just add the word "checked" to the inside of an input element. For example:

<input type="radio" name="test-name" checked>

<form action="/submit-cat-photo">
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"checked> Indoor</label>
  <label><input type="radio" name="indoor-outdoor"> Outdoor</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"checked> Loving</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Lazy</label>
  <label><input type="checkbox" name="personality"> Energetic</label>
  <input type="text" placeholder="cat photo URL" required>
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>

The div element, also known as a division element, is a general purpose container for other elements.

The div element is probably the most commonly used HTML element of all. It's useful for passing the CSS of its own class declarations down to all the elements that it contains.

Just like any other non-self-closing element, you can open a div element with <div> and close it on another line with </div>.

<div>
  <p>Things cats love:</p>
<ul>
  <li>cat nip</li>
  <li>laser pointers</li>
  <li>lasagna</li>
</ul>
<p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
<ol>
  <li>flea treatment</li>
  <li>thunder</li>
  <li>other cats</li>
</ol>
</div>

You can set an element's background color with the background-color property.

For example, if you wanted an element's background color to be green, you'd put this within your style element:

.green-background {
  background-color: green;
}

<div
  class="silver-background
  <p>Things cats love:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>cat nip</li>
    <li>laser pointers</li>
    <li>lasagna</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Top 3 things cats hate:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>flea treatment</li>
    <li>thunder</li>
    <li>other cats</li>
  </ol>

></div>
