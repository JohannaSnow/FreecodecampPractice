<h1>Hello World</h1>

<h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<!-- The style that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the "color" style.  -->

<!-- When you entered <h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>, you were giving that individual h2 element an inline style. -->

<!-- Inside that style element, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, your style element would look like this: -->
<style>
  h2{color: blue;}
</style>

<!-- You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.

You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:

<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period. -->


 <style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

  All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.
Note that in most cases, img elements are self-closing.

<img src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="Kitty relaxing upside down ">

CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.
<style>
.larger-image {
   width: 100px;
 }
< /style>


/*changing size of image*/
<style>
.smaller-image {
  width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<img class="smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. " >


<!-- Remember that you can apply multiple classes to an element by separating each class with a space within its class attribute. For example: -->

<img class="class1 class2">

<style>

  .smaller-image {
    width: 100px;
  }
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<img class="smaller-image thick-green-border"  src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. ">

 We can round out those corners with a CSS property called border-radius.

<style><
 .thick-green-border {
   border-color: green;
   border-width: 10px;
   border-style: solid;
   border-radius: 10px;
 }
 </style>

 In addition to pixels, you can also specify a border-radius using a percentage.


 <style><
  .thick-green-border {
    border-color: green;
    border-width: 10px;
    border-style: solid;
    border-radius: 50%;
  }
  </style>

  a elements, also known as anchor elements, are used to link to content outside of the current page.

Nesting just means putting one element inside of another element.

Dead Links:

Sometimes you want to add a elements to your website before you know where they will link.

This is also handy when you're changing the behavior of a link using jQuery, which we'll learn about later.

Replace the value of your a element's href attribute with a #, also known as a hash symbol, to turn it into a dead link.
