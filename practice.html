<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

<h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<!-- The style that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the "color" style.  -->

<!-- When you entered <h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>, you were giving that individual h2 element an inline style. -->

<!-- Inside that style element, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, your style element would look like this: -->
<style>
  h2{color: blue;}
</style>

<!-- You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.

You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:

<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period. -->


 <style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>
