<h1>Hello World</h1>

<p>Kitty ipsum dolor sit amet, shed everywhere shed everywhere stretching attack your ankles chase the red dot, hairball run catnip eat the grass sniff.</p>

<h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>

<!-- The style that is responsible for the color of an element's text is the "color" style.  -->

<!-- When you entered <h2 style="color: red">CatPhotoApp</h2>, you were giving that individual h2 element an inline style. -->

<!-- Inside that style element, you can create a CSS selector for all h2 elements. For example, if you wanted all h2 elements to be red, your style element would look like this: -->
<style>
  h2{color: blue;}
</style>

<!-- You can see that we've created a CSS class called blue-text within the <style> tag.

You can apply a class to an HTML element like this:

<h2 class="blue-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

Note that in your CSS style element, classes should start with a period. In your HTML elements' class declarations, classes shouldn't start with a period. -->


 <style>
  .red-text {
    color: red;
  }

  p {
    font-size: 16px;
    font-family: Monospace;
  }
</style>

<h2 class="red-text">CatPhotoApp</h2>

  All img elements must have an alt attribute. The text inside an alt attribute is used for screen readers to improve accessibility and is displayed if the image fails to load.
Note that in most cases, img elements are self-closing.

CSS has a property called width that controls an element's width. Just like with fonts, we'll use px (pixels) to specify the image's width.
<style>
.larger-image {
   width: 100px;
 }
< /style>


/*changing size of image*/
<style>
.smaller-image {
  width: 100px;
  }
</style>

<img class="smaller-image" src="https://bit.ly/fcc-relaxing-cat" alt="A cute orange cat lying on its back. " >
